Communications images

This is a folder that has images to be embedded in documents. 
Since GitHub does not have lots of storage capacity, we need
to make sure to delete the folders every month or so. Every 
file in the img folder should be named:

dd-mmm-yyyy__TITLE

where:
The date is the date to DELETE the image

dd 		- day in numbers (ex 12 or 02)
mmm 	- month in letters in esp (ex ene or feb)
yyyy 	- year in numbers (ex 1996 or 2008)

TITLE 	- name of image

To access or embed the images, simply use the URL:
"https://caminosdeagua.github.io/com-img/img/dd-mmm-yyyy__TITLE"
